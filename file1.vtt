1
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.560
so in the previous video we looked at

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.630
the git status command i'm sure you
so in the previous video we looked at

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.160
probably agree at this point that it was
the git status command i'm sure you

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.599
really quite helpful in providing us
probably agree at this point that it was

5
00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.550
information on what was going on with
really quite helpful in providing us

6
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.070
particular files now you probably saw
information on what was going on with

7
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.720
that one point there's instructions
particular files now you probably saw

8
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.359
relating to undoing changes in the
that one point there's instructions

9
00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.210
staging area and the working directory so
relating to undoing changes in the

10
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.160
let's actually go through and see this
staging area and the working directory so

11
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.630
for ourselves by actually carrying out
let's actually go through and see this

12
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.970
some changes and then reverting or
for ourselves by actually carrying out

13
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.859
removing or backing out of those
some changes and then reverting or

14
00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.529
changes so we're going to start a
removing or backing out of those

15
00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.670
terminal the bash shell going to go
changes so we're going to start a

16
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.819
to my repository standard repository
terminal the bash shell going to go

17
00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:39.350
we've been using i'm going to go into
to my repository standard repository

18
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.850
the converted git repository that was
we've been using i'm going to go into

19
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.859
if you recall was the one that was the java
the converted git repository that was

20
00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.289
project from my java course that we
if you recall was the one that was the java

21
00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.899
downloaded for the purposes of testing and
project from my java course that we

22
00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.579
let's actually go ahead and modify files
downloaded for the purposes of testing and

23
00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.739
so what I want to do is have a look at this
let's actually go ahead and modify files

24
00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.379
sorted collections .iml that
so what I want to do is have a look at this

25
00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.659
obviously only an example file if you're
sorted collections .iml that

26
00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.760
using another test project obviously
obviously only an example file if you're

27
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.030
edit any file from from that project
using another test project obviously

28
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.270
in my case gonna do....
edit any file from from that project

29
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.730
....this is
in my case gonna do....

30
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.500
actually the output or the file that's
....this is

31
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.840
is maintained by IntelliJ when you're
actually the output or the file that's

32
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.200
using that for a java ide so basically
is maintained by IntelliJ when you're

33
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.670
just going to put something in the file
using that for a java ide so basically

34
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.020
to indicate that its change so
just going to put something in the file

35
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.900
going to come down here and press enter
to indicate that its change so

36
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.790
just to add an extra line just
going to come down here and press enter

37
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.740
basically want to do something anything
just to add an extra line just

38
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.300
so that the file is actually different to
basically want to do something anything

39
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.160
what it was prior to you editing it and
so that the file is actually different to

40
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.390
save the change
what it was prior to you editing it and

41
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.820
bearing in mind that we've already added
save the change

42
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.310
this project to git so as far as git is
bearing in mind that we've already added

43
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.050
concerned this is a file that has been
this project to git so as far as git is

44
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.310
monitoring is being monitored or
concerned this is a file that has been

45
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.690
tracked by git
monitoring is being monitored or

46
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.300
notice how the command prompts changed
tracked by git

47
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.940
to a star now and if we type...you can
notice how the command prompts changed

48
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.800
see that sorted collections has
to a star now and if we type...you can

49
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.080
now been modified and currently there's
see that sorted collections has

50
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.000
no changes added to commit you need to
now been modified and currently there's

51
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.850
use the git add command or git commit
no changes added to commit you need to

52
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.670
command with the dash a but also up here
use the git add command or git commit

53
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.100
notice that git you can use the git
command with the dash a but also up here

54
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.170
checkout to discard changes in the
notice that git you can use the git

55
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.269
working directory so lets actually see
checkout to discard changes in the

56
00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:09.349
how that works
working directory so lets actually see

57
00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.329
now this check out command is a versatile
how that works

58
00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.280
command which can be used for many
now this check out command is a versatile

59
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.510
things
command which can be used for many

60
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.370
one thing that you can use it for is
things

61
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.170
carrying out what we wanting
 one thing that you can use it for is

62
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.360
to do now which is to undo the
carrying out what we wanting

63
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.730
changes that we made to this in this case the
to do now which is to undo the

64
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.489
sorted collections .iml file and it's
changes that we made to this in this case the

65
00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.439
also used to switch branches among other
sorted collections .iml file and it's

66
00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.870
things we're not gonna be going into a
also used to switch branches among other

67
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.060
lot of detail with the check out you can
things we're not gonna be going into a

68
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.890
look at bib hashes git complete
lot of detail with the check out you can

69
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.170
mastery course if you want to find out
look at bib hashes git complete

70
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.629
more on some of the more advanced
mastery course if you want to find out

71
00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.579
commands in this case what we're going
more on some of the more advanced

72
00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.829
to use it for is to basically revert
commands in this case what we're going

73
00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.989
that change or undo the change so going to
to use it for is to basically revert

74
00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.069
type....
that change or undo the change so going to

75
00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.659
....
type....

76
00:02:50.659 --> 00:03:03.769
....
....

77
00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.150
....on branch master nothing
....

78
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.239
commit working trees clean but lets
....on branch master nothing

79
00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:11.989
actually have a look at the file now
commit working trees clean but lets

80
00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.470
so...
actually have a look at the file now

81
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.870
and notice that the blank
so...

82
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.810
line that i added has now been
and notice that the blank

83
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.500
removed
line that i added has now been

84
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.030
so what's happening is by using that git
removed

85
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.280
check out command the latest version
so what's happening is by using that git

86
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.940
that was in the git database has
check out command the latest version

87
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.230
overridden what's in the working
that was in the git database has

88
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.090
directory so we've got back to the last
overridden what's in the working

89
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.010
current version of the file that
directory so we've got back to the last

90
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.900
we save previously in the git database
current version of the file that

91
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.239
so that is what the check out command
we save previously in the git database

92
00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.040
does alright let's do the same thing as we
so that is what the check out command

93
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.540
did before going to edit the file again
does alright let's do the same thing as we

94
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.910
this time we're going to add another line
did before going to edit the file again

95
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.489
somewhere or add a couple lines just
this time we're going to add another line

96
00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.959
so we know that it's different
somewhere or add a couple lines just

97
00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.139
save it this time we're gonna add so....
so we know that it's different

98
00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.900
....
save it this time we're gonna add so....

99
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.049
....
....

100
00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.609
noting this time because we've issued the git add
....

101
00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.949
command it's red changes are ready to be
noting this time because we've issued the git add

102
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:11.030
committed now that's telling us to use
command it's red changes are ready to be

103
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.549
the git reset head command to unstage
committed now that's telling us to use

104
00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.859
to unstage would be to take it out of
the git reset head command to unstage

105
00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.109
the index or that sort of staging
to unstage would be to take it out of

106
00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.209
area so let's actually try doing that
the index or that sort of staging

107
00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.820
so do.....
area so let's actually try doing that

108
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.710
....
so do.....

109
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.130
....
....

110
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.700
....you can see
....

111
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.870
we've got some output there that says
....you can see

112
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.720
unstage changes after reset and the
we've got some output there that says

113
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.490
capital letter m there then the file name
unstage changes after reset and the

114
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.100
sorted collections .iml let's
capital letter m there then the file name

115
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.780
check out what the git status command
sorted collections .iml let's

116
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.870
shows us now and you can see it's taking
check out what the git status command

117
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.820
us back to the previous state we now
shows us now and you can see it's taking

118
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.370
need to issue the git add command if you
us back to the previous state we now

119
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.080
did want to ultimately commit the file
need to issue the git add command if you

120
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.510
and then we could actually go through
did want to ultimately commit the file

121
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.400
now if we wanted to do and do what we did
and then we could actually go through

122
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.230
earlier in this video git check out
now if we wanted to do and do what we did

123
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.070
....
earlier in this video git check out

124
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.100
and that reverts the changes so
....

125
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.290
that we go back to our file again.....
and that reverts the changes so

126
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.510
...you
that we go back to our file again.....

127
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.130
can see those two black lines no longer
...you

128
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.810
appear and we've got what is the latest
can see those two black lines no longer

129
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.450
version of the sorted collection IML file
appear and we've got what is the latest

130
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.100
from the git database
version of the sorted collection IML file

131
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.590
alright so that's what we've done
from the git database

132
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.720
there is gone through undoing actions
alright so that's what we've done

133
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.960
in a repository that already existed and
there is gone through undoing actions

134
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.160
that course meant that they were tracked
in a repository that already existed and

135
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.200
files in the repository and git was
that course meant that they were tracked

136
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.370
monitoring them and you saw that we
files in the repository and git was

137
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.020
change those and then went through various
monitoring them and you saw that we

138
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.020
commands to remove those changes but the
change those and then went through various

139
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.060
command for unstaging is a little bit
commands to remove those changes but the

140
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.890
different if we work in a repository
